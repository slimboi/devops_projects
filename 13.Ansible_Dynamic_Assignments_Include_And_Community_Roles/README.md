## **ANSIBLE DYNAMIC ASSIGNMENTS (INCLUDE) AND COMMUNITY ROLES**
---

**INTRODUCING DYNAMIC ASSIGNMENT INTO OUR STRUCTURE**

1. In my https://github.com/slimboi/ansible-config-mgt.git GitHub repository, I have created a new branch and called it `dynamic-assignments`.

2. Create a new folder, name it `dynamic-assignments`. Then inside this folder, create a new file and name it `env-vars.yml`. We will instruct `site.yml` to include this playbook later. 

Your GitHub shall have following structure by now.

Note: Depending on what method you used in the previous project you may have or not have `roles` folder in your GitHub repository – if you used ansible-galaxy, then roles directory was only created on your `Jenkins-Ansible` server locally. It is recommended to have all the codes managed and tracked in GitHub, so you might want to recreate this structure manually in this case.

```
├── dynamic-assignments
│   └── env-vars.yml
├── inventory
│   └── dev
    └── stage
    └── uat
    └── prod
└── playbooks
    └── site.yml
└── roles (optional folder)
    └──...(optional subfolders & files)
└── static-assignments
    └── common.yml
```

Since we will be using the same Ansible to configure multiple environments, and each of these environments will have certain unique attributes, such as servername, ip-address etc., we will need a way to set values to variables per specific environment.

For this reason, we will now create a folder to keep each environment’s variables file. Therefore, create a new folder `env-vars`, then for each environment, create new YAML files which we will use to set variables.

Your layout should now look like this.

```
├── dynamic-assignments
│   └── env-vars.yml
├── env-vars
    └── dev.yml
    └── stage.yml
    └── uat.yml
    └── prod.yml
├── inventory
    └── dev
    └── stage
    └── uat
    └── prod
├── playbooks
    └── site.yml
└── static-assignments
    └── common.yml
    └── webservers.yml
```

Now paste the instruction below into the env-vars.yml file.

```

- name: collate variables from env specific file, if it exists
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: looping through list of available files
      include_vars: "{{ item }}"
      with_first_found:
        - files:
            - dev.yml
            - stage.yml
            - prod.yml
            - uat.yml
          paths:
            - "{{ playbook_dir }}/../env-vars"
      tags:
        - always
```
