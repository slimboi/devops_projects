# DevOps-Website-Solution

In this project, as a member of a DevOps team I am implementing a tooling website solution which provide access to essential DevOps tools within the corporate infrastructure. The tools are well known and widely used by multiple DevOps teams. The DevOps Tooling Solution consists of;

1. Jenkins - free and open source automation server used to build CI/CD pipelines.

2. Kubernetes - an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.

3. Jfrog Artifactory - Universal Repository Manager supporting all major packaging formats, build tools and CI servers. Artifactory.

4. Rancher - an open source software platform that enables organizations to run and manage Docker and Kubernetes in production.

5. Grafana - a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application.

6. Prometheus - An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.

7. Kibana - Kibana is a free and open user interface that lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack.
